## 📚 Research Spotlights

The latest breakthroughs and scholarly highlights worth exploring:
### 📄 [GGTalker: Talking Head Systhesis with Generalizable Gaussian Priors and Identity-Specific Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21513v1)

- The creation of high-quality, 3D talking heads that can handle large head rotations and out-of-distribution audio is challenging, particularly due to the lack of sufficient 3D priors and the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training.
- The proposed solution, GGTalker, combines generalizable priors with identity-specific adaptation through a two-stage Prior-Adaptation training strategy. The system utilizes Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual priors for universal lip movement patterns and head texture distribution, then adapts to individual speaking styles and texture details.
- GGTalker also includes a color MLP for generating fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a Body Inpainter for blending rendered results with the background, resulting in photorealistic

### 📄 [Aligning Spoken Dialogue Models from User Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21463v1)

- A new preference alignment framework has been developed to improve spoken dialogue models used in real-time conversations, addressing the unique challenges of speech interactions such as interruptions and lack of explicit speaker segmentation. 
- A large-scale dataset of over 150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated with AI feedback, was created to cover preferences over linguistic content and temporal context variations. 
- The new framework has been shown to be effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer, and contextually aligned interactions, highlighting the importance of a well-calibrated balance among various dynamics for natural real-time speech dialogue systems.

### 📄 [ThinkSound: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models for Audio Generation and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21448v1)

- A new framework called ThinkSound has been introduced that uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to facilitate step-by-step, interactive audio generation and editing for videos. This process is divided into three stages: foundational foley generation, interactive object-centric refinement, and targeted editing based on natural language instructions.
- To guide the audio foundation model, a multimodal large language model generates CoT reasoning that aligns with the context at each stage.
- A new dataset, AudioCoT, has been introduced, which offers structured reasoning annotations that link visual content, textual descriptions, and sound synthesis. ThinkSound has shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation, excelling in the out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio benchmark
