### 🎯 [Google tests Audio Overviews for Search queries](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/google-tests-audio-overviews-for-search-queries/)
- Google is experimenting with Audio Overviews for search queries, aiming to provide users with brief audio summaries of their search results.
- This feature could potentially be beneficial to visually impaired users or those who prefer audio content over text, enhancing accessibility and user experience.
- The test is currently in its early stages, and it's unclear when or if Google plans to officially launch this feature to all users.

## 📚 Research Highlights
### 📄 [GGTalker: Talking Head Systhesis with Generalizable Gaussian Priors and Identity-Specific Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21513v1)
- The creation of realistic 3D talking heads is a challenge, especially with large head rotations and out-of-distribution audio. Existing methods require time-consuming, identity-specific training. 
- A new solution, GGTalker, uses a combination of generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation to address these issues. It uses a two-stage Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to individual characteristics.
- GGTalker also introduces a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing photorealistic video frames. It has proven to achieve high performance in rendering quality, 3D consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.
### 📄 [Aligning Spoken Dialogue Models from User Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21463v1)
- A new preference alignment framework has been developed to enhance spoken dialogue models for real-time conversations, addressing complexities such as interruptions, interjections, and lack of explicit speaker turn segmentation. 
- A large-scale dataset of over 150,000 preference pairs from multi-turn speech conversations has been created, annotated with AI feedback to cover linguistic content and temporal context variations. 
- The model, fine-tuned using offline alignment methods, has shown consistent effectiveness in improving spoken dialogue models, producing more factual, safer, and contextually aligned interactions. The study highlights the importance of a balanced approach to various dynamics for natural real-time speech dialogue systems.
### 📄 [ThinkSound: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models for Audio Generation and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21448v1)
- The new framework, ThinkSound, uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to produce high-quality audio that accurately reflects visual content in videos. The process is split into three stages: foundational foley generation, interactive object-centric refinement, and targeted editing guided by natural language instructions.
- A multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning at each stage, guiding a unified audio foundation model. This allows for stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing.
- The team also introduces AudioCoT, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning annotations that link visual content, textual descriptions, and sound synthesis. ThinkSound has demonstrated top-tier performance in video-to-audio generation across audio and CoT metrics and performs well in the out-of-d
